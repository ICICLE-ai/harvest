            <strong>Title: </strong>Plows to Neurons: The Role of HPC and AI in Agriculture<br />
            <strong>Abstract: </strong>The convergence of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the landscape of autonomy and automation in agriculture. In this keynote, we explore how HPC serves as the backbone for advancing AI-driven systems, unlocking new capabilities in decision-making, real-time processing, and adaptive control. We emphasize the critical importance of performance per watt, highlighting the need to optimize energy efficiency as AI adoption scales in resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, we argue that while larger AI models have garnered significant attention, there is a pressing demand for more efficient and specialized AI architectures that deliver superior performance without compromising computational resources. Lastly, we discuss the necessity of innovative sensor fusion methods to enhance situational awareness and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. By addressing these challenges, we pave the way for smarter, more sustainable, and scalable autonomous systems that will shape the future of technology.<br />

          <strong>Title:</strong><br />
            <p>AI – Agricultural Interoperability: Evolving Data Standards in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</p>
          <strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
          <p>For over two decades, AgGateway has addressed data interoperability challenges across the agricultural value chain, from standardized B2B messaging in the input supply chain to open-source tools that unlock high-resolution geospatial data from precision equipment. Throughout this journey, waves of technological innovation have shaped the member-led work, but few have shown as much transformative potential as the current surge in artificial intelligence.</p>
          <p>This session will explore historical parallels between past tech disruptions and today’s AI moment, highlighting how tools like chatbots and generative models are beginning to influence interoperability efforts. We’ll examine how agricultural data standards work is shifting and what new priorities are emerging among AgGateway members.</p>
          <strong>Bio:</strong><br />
            <p>Ben Craker is the Portfolio Manager at AgGateway, a global nonprofit organization whose members develop digital resources to address interoperability issues across agricultural industry sectors by providing a unique forum where companies can meet to solve digital challenges. In this role Ben helps facilitate working groups as they address pain points identified by the member organizations.</p>
            <p>He is also the president of the Ag Data Coalition (ADC), serving in that role since its founding in 2016. The ADC is a non-profit organization that promotes farmer control of data and operates an independent data repository farmers, researchers, and industry can use to store and permission access to data. The ultimate ADC goal is to make data storage a pre-competitive space in the agricultural industry.</p>
            <p>Prior to joining AgGateway staff he spent eighteen years in the farm equipment manufacturing industry at AGCO and Kuhn North America. He held both positions in marketing, sales, global partnering, and product management. He grew up on a farm in south central Wisconsin and graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville with a BS in agricultural business with an engineering technology emphasis. He is still actively involved in the family farm, living in south-central Wisconsin with his wife and three children.</p>

          <strong>Title:</strong><br />
            <p>xGFabric: Coupling Sensor Networks and High-performance Computing
            Facilities with Advanced Wireless Networks for Near 
            Real-Time Simulation of Digital Agriculture</p>
          <strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
            <p>Modern agriculture faces urgent challenges from climate variability and
            increasing global demands that require rapid, real-time decision support.
            Traditional High-performance computing systems, remotely sited sensor networks
            fail to provide the unified, adaptive insights needed for optimal crop
            management and biosecurity. Emerging 5G/6G technologies—with adaptive
            low-latency and high-throughput capabilities—offer a transformative
            opportunity to bridge this gap by creating a resilient, unified, and secure
            digital-physical fabric, enabling innovative scientific applications in
            digital agriculture.</p>
            <p>In this talk, we will present xGFabric -- and end-to-end system for coupling
            IoT devices and actuators with HPC systems to implement
            "modeling-in-the-loop" applications. xGFabric takes advantage of
            innovations in 5G/6G network infrastructure and a full-stack distributed
            runtime system to unify computing, network, and storage devices at all device
            scales.  We will discuss the xGFabric architecture and discuss a working
            prototype that uses in-the-loop Computational Fluid Dynamics to generates
            real-time predictions of growing conditions for citrus in a specialized
            facility located in the California Central Valley.</p>

            <strong>Title: </strong> Building a Data Infrastructure for Agriculture in Arizona<br />
            <strong>Abstract: </strong>While Arizona is not likely to be one of the first states that comes to mind when thinking about agricultural production in the US, agriculture in Arizona supports over 130,000 jobs, has a $23.3B economic impact, with exports to over 70 countries.  The Yuma Valley in southwestern Arizona produces 90% of the leafy greens consumed in North America between November and March.  Given the limited water supply, this kind of productivity could only be achieved by embracing technology.  Today, this means embracing AI which means embracing the collection of data.  Arizona has several resources, including Biosphere 2 and an outdoor phenotying facility , that will be essential for collecting the data needed to build new models needed for agriculture.<br />
            <strong>Speaker Bio: </strong>Arthur B. (Barney) Maccabe is a professor in the College of Information Science at The University of Arizona.  From 2009 to 2022, Dr Maccabe served as the Director of the Computer Science and Mathematics Division (CSMD) at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and as the ORNL Point of Contact for the research portion of the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program in the Department of Energy, Office of Science.  Prior to his appointment at ORNL, Dr. Maccabe spent over twenty-five years as a professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of New Mexico (UNM) where he graduated eleven PhD students and nine MS students.  While at UNM, Dr. Maccabe also served as the director of the Center for High Performance Computing and as the Interim Chief Information Officer for the university.<br />
            Professor Maccabe’s current research is focused on mechanisms and policies to ensure that the creators of data are able to realize value for the information they provide. His previous research focused on the design and development of system software for massively parallel systems. He was an architect for a series of lightweight operating systems for massively parallel computing systems. Dr. Maccabe has also conducted sponsored research in a wide- range of areas, including: dependence representation for compilers, network intrusion detection, network protocol offload, lightweight file and I/O systems, system software for sensor networks, and virtualization in high end computing systems.<br />
